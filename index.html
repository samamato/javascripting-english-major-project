      <br><p>Disney was a staple of my childhood and is why I’m now one of those crazy ‘Disney Adults’. It’s basically a personality trait at this point. I live and breathe all things Disney and as I got older the obsession only got worse. From an early age I had all the Disney toys, pajamas, and movies on VHS. My parents had me hooked. Aside from that, my parents took my sister and me to Disney World many times and it quickly became one of my favorite places to be. I feel like I sound a little crazy but it’s truly become my happy place. I can’t be mad when I’m there, it’s always just pure joy. I mean come on Cinderella’s Castle is beautiful. That feeling of walking down Main Street and seeing it is just a feeling like no other. It’s my top place to be and that’s why I decided to spend my 21st birthday at the ‘Happiest Place on Earth’. </p></br>
      <p>My map shows some of my favorites at Walt Disney World. I ended up picking one spot from each category. My map shows my favorite park, hotel, ride, restaurant, and show. When you take a look at my map you’ll get to learn a little about my favorite spots and why they are my favorites. Although I’ve been to Disney a handful of times, it’s important to mention that any trip I reference is my birthday trip from last June. That trip holds a special place in my heart. It was the first time I had been back to Disney since I was 15 and it felt so different. In a way it felt like I never left, but it also felt so new and exciting. I definitely found a new appreciation for the parks on that trip. I also planned our entire trip from start to finish to ensure we did as much as possible in the short time we were there. Truly a trip I’ll never forget and just solidified why Disney is so special to me. </p>
